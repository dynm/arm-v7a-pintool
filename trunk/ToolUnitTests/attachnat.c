/*
 * This test verifies that Pin can attach to a process when one of the integer registers has a NaT
 * bit set.  The NatCheck() routine forces a NaT bit to be set and then delays for a short while.
 * In order for the test to be valid, Pin should attempt to attach during this delay.  After the
 * delay, the test verifies that the NaT bit is still set (i.e. it's still set when running jitted
 * within Pin).
 *
 * Currently, this test fails because of a bug in the kernel implementation of ptrace().  It appears
 * that the Pin process is not able to read the values of the NaT bits via ptrace() when attaching to
 * the application process.  The debugger appears to have a similar problem, as it is also not able
 * to correctly print the values of any NaT bits.  If this kernel bug is ever fixed, we should
 * re-enable this test.
